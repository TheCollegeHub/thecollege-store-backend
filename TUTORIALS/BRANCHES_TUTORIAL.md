# 🌿 Branches Tutorial  
### A Guided Journey Through Each Stage of The College Store Ecosystem

This document will guide you through the **incremental ecosystem** of The College Store by using specific branches that represent different stages of the system.  

Instead of jumping directly into the full and complete ecosystem, you can explore the platform **step by step**, understanding each feature in isolation or as part of a growing flow — always maintaining an **end-to-end experience**.

Each branch represents a point in the product's evolution.  
As you advance, you will see how the system becomes more robust, more complex, and closer to the final architecture.

## 🧭 How This Works

You can think of this as a **learning path** where each branch introduces new concepts, features, or architectural decisions.

- Want only a **minimal environment** to understand the basics? Start at the MVP.
- Want to see how caching, queues, gRPC, and more are gradually introduced? Follow the next branches.
- Want the final and complete ecosystem? Follow the final tutorial in the main README.

Every step has its own documentation and instructions, which you will find linked below.
